    Value                                         Description                                                           Reference
           Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm based on link metric. This is the standard shortest
   0       path algorithm as computed by the IGP protocol. Consistent with the deployed practice for  [RFC-ietf-ospf-segment-routing-extensions-24]
           link-state protocols, Algorithm 0 permits any node to overwrite the SPF path with a
           different path based on its local policy.
           Strict Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm based on link metric. The algorithm is
   1       identical to Algorithm 0 but Algorithm 1 requires that all nodes along the path will honor [RFC-ietf-ospf-segment-routing-extensions-24]
           the SPF routing decision. Local policy at the node claiming support for Algorithm 1 MUST
           NOT alter the SPF paths computed by Algorithm 1.
